# Decentralized AI Onboarding Platform (DAIOP)

@EthIndia23


DAIOP is a decentralized application (DApp) built using Next.js, Solidity, The Graph, RainbowKit, and Wagmi. It revolutionizes the onboarding process for Language Model Owners (LLM) onto the blockchain. Users can seamlessly onboard their LLMs onto the platform and leverage decentralized AI for various tasks. The DApp allows users to interact with their LLMs by submitting queries and context, which are randomly distributed among the onboarded models. If the response generated is correct, the LLM owner is rewarded, fostering a collaborative and incentivized decentralized AI ecosystem.

DAIOP addresses the challenges in onboarding Language Models onto the blockchain, providing a decentralized AI solution for users. It enables individuals to utilize AI for diverse applications, from natural language processing to task automation. By incentivizing correct responses, DAIOP promotes the accuracy and reliability of decentralized AI, making it accessible and beneficial for a wide range of users.
